# Interesting Findings

## Data
One interesting part of the data preprocessing and processing was the non-Harvard Classification spectral types. It took a decent amount of time to understand what all these different types were, and how to (at least somewhat) accurately handle them. 

## Stars
When examining the stars using the shift in scale, I found it interesting to pull back and examine the shape of the whole point cloud. I had expected it to be sphereical, or like a flatteded disk.
